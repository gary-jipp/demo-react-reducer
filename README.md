# React useReducer

- [ ] useReducer() lets you separate state management logic from the rendering logic of the component.

- [ ] Useful with complex states with many update operations

- [ ] Less useful for simple state

- [ ] Component no longer needs to deal with "how" state is updated, only request that it be done

- [ ] Allows fewer state update fuctions props to be used with components
